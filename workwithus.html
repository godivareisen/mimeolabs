      <p>Mimeo Labs is a global network of people who are committed to working for the environment. Through a combination of fieldwork and remote coordination, Mimeo Labs harnesses mimeo technology to replenish natural resources and rebuild the natural landscape. We are always accepting applications for the following positions:</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>citizen ecologist</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>This position requires the ability to work in the field and the desire to get one's hands dirty. Citizen ecologists will work on the ground to collect material data using a mimeograph. They will collaborate remotely with material programmers to determine where mimeos need to be activated——that is, where features or resources need to be replenished in the natural environment.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>material programmer</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>This position requires a strong background in material science——experience in environmental science a plus. Basic programming skills preferred, though material programmers will be trained to use the mimeo programming language. Material programmers will process and re-code material data collected by citizen ecologists.</p>

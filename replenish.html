      <br>
      <p>Once material programmers commit their instructions to the mimeo cloud, those instructions become <strong><font color = "#f7941d">knowledge</font></strong> that the mimeos will use once deployed. Citizen ecologists and material programmers jointly identify when and where they need to instruct mimeos to replicate an environmental feature, assembling according to material and structural properties outlined in the mimeo cloud.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong><font color = "#f7941d">For example</font></strong>, a citizen ecologist based in Los Angeles wanting to address the dwindling population of native palm trees might coordinate with a material programmer to create palm trees that provide more fruit and shade, require less water, and have a longer lifespan. They would instruct mimeos in the Greater Los Angeles Area to replicate these augmented palm trees in the places that the previous palms had died.</p>
